# Tools for Improving Online Privacy

Now that we've discussed the basics of online privacy, as well as why online privacy is important, the next step is understanding *what you can do* to improve your privacy. As always, let me preface this article by saying that I'm not a professional or certified cybersecurity expert. I'm just a random person who's interested in this kind of thing, so take everything here with a grain of salt. That being said, let's get started.

## Privacy Guides

If I had to point to *a single resource* that comprehensively covers all of your online privacy needs, I would, without a doubt, recommend Privacy Guides. This website includes every tool that I use to protect myself online *and much more*. In fact, as I was writing this article and skimming their site, I found a lot of useful stuff that I had no idea even existed! A lot of the resources that Privacy Guides recommends are genuinely useful and great tools, but there's also a lot of stuff that most people probably don't need, like self-hosted email, custom mobile OSs, etc. Don't worry about covering every single aspect of online privacy mentioned by Privacy Guides; think about what you do most on the Internet and what you need, and go from there. 

## Recommendations

Below, I'll summarize a few general recommendations from Privacy Guides that will help most people. If you want more in-depth explanations and the rationale for why these tools are great, you can visit the links I've provided to see the full Privacy Guide pages. If there's anything you don't understand, don't be afraid! Do some extra research and come back. 

First, it's important to choose a good web browser simply because of how much time we spend on one. An incredible wealth of data is generated when you browse the web - that data is profit for corporations, mind you - so this is one of the most important steps you can take. Privacy Guides recommends browsers like Firefox for desktop browsing, Safari for IOS users, and something like Brave for Android. Personally, I use Firefox and Safari (with some extra configuration you can find on the Privacy Guides pages) and the experience has been great. In addition to choosing a good web browser, it's equally important to choose the right browser extensions. Privacy Guides recommends uBlock Origin, which is an ad and tracker blocker that works wonders. Again, this is something I use and I 100% recommend it. Last, but certainly not least, you should choose a good search engine - one that doesn't log, track, and sell everything you search and do. Privacy Guides recommends a few, such as DuckDuckGo, and from personal experience, I can say that DDG works well. *A common excuse I hear* from people who stick with Google is “Well, the search results probably aren't as good!” And while that can be true in certain situations, I've found over a long period that alternative search engines *work just as well as Google.*

Privacy Guides also covers some service providers for cloud data storage - essentially alternatives to something like Dropbox or Google Drive - as well as some good alternative email providers like Proton Mail. Again, Proton Mail is something I've personally used and recommend. Other than that, I would recommend something like Mullvad VPN. VPNs are great because they hide your IP - by extension, your location - and they hide your activity from your ISP. They can also be used to bypass certain network restrictions and filters, not to mention that they make using public networks feasible. 

## Conclusion

All the tools I've summarized are just scratching the surface and are good, *general* recommendations. Privacy Guides covers a myriad of tools in great detail, so depending on what kind of stuff you do on the internet, I would highly recommend reading through some of their articles thoroughly based on your needs. Online privacy, as I've mentioned before, is a hugely complicated topic, so don't stop here!! Keep researching and taking steps every day to improve online privacy for yourself and others.
