# Why Should you Care About Online Privacy?

Maybe you're thinking something along the lines of, “Corporations and the government already know everything about me! *There's no use…*” Or, even worse, “Why should I care if *I have nothing to hide?*” Perhaps you're even thinking, “Ew, Firefox? Nobody uses that…” These are just some of the things that I've heard when I try to talk with people about online privacy - and yes, **some people really are so attached to their favorite brands that they would even prefer the ones that violate their rights every day.**


As I've mentioned (and praised) in other articles, Privacy Guides has a great resource on the importance of online privacy, so I'd highly recommend you go read that first. You can find that [here](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/basics/why-privacy-matters/)

## The Constitution

First, privacy is (or at least, should be) a fundamental right. In the US, privacy is protected by the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution. The protection of privacy was held so highly by the founders that they put it in the Constitution, right up there with the protection of free speech. It is simply unacceptable for people to neglect the violation of their Constitutional rights.

## "I Have Nothing to Hide"

If you're one of those people that say, “I don't care what corporations know about me - I have nothing to hide!” In the words of Edward Snowden, “Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.” As the Privacy Guides article above states, “…it creates a sense that people who demand privacy must be deviant, criminal, or wrong.”

## Favorite Brands

As for the people who have big tech brand preferences, I can't speak for all of them of course, but one of the most common reasons for their preference is the quality of the service. “Alternative browsers and/or search engines just aren't as good!” I hear people say, but those people probably have never tried the alternatives once, nor have they done an ounce of research on those alternatives. The truth is, pro-privacy tech alternatives are just as good 90% of the time.

Another reason people might have big tech preferences is the convenience. And, well, it's pretty hard to argue! Big tech is attractive because of its quality, convenience, and often cheap or free price. (Remember, if it's free, you're the product being sold) This points to a deeper truth about privacy: you have to be willing to trade some convenience for privacy. In a lot of cases, though, the convenience tradeoff isn’t as bad as people think. It just takes a bit of research and some time to set up, and it's very much achievable for anyone to do.

## There's no Use

Finally, if you think privacy is a futile effort because you've already given everything away, it's not. Every step counts, no matter how big or small. Even if it's just switching your search engine, that seemingly small change can have a huge positive impact on your privacy. Just remember: It's never too late to begin your journey.
