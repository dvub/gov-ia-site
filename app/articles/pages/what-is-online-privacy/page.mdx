# What is Online Privacy?


If you’ve spent any amount of time on the internet, you’ve probably seen the term “online privacy,” whether it be in some advertisement for a VPN provider or other privacy-enhancing tool, an article on how to improve online privacy, or something else entirely. Before diving too deep into the rabbit hole that is online privacy, it would help to understand what online privacy is in the first place. All of those articles and advertisements make online privacy sound so important to protect, but what are you even trying to protect, and is it really that important? (Spoiler: yes, it is that important!) This article is meant to be a short, introductory piece that explains the basics of online privacy. Online privacy and privacy more generally are pretty complicated topics, so I’ll do my best to provide links to other resources for readers wanting a more comprehensive understanding.

## First, What is Privacy?

First, let’s define privacy. According to the [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/privacy), privacy is “the quality or state of being apart from company or observation,” or “freedom from unauthorized intrusion.” In the US, the Constitution protects the privacy of individuals with the [Fourth Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-4/), by requiring a warrant (issued by a judge) for law enforcement to search people and their belongings. If you want to learn more about privacy in general, I would recommend starting with the [Wikipedia article.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy) (I know this may offend some strict scholars who firmly stand against Wikipedia, but I think Wikipedia is often a good starting point, and if you want to learn more from more credible sources, just look through the references!)



Following from the definitions above, online privacy, then, would be a person’s ability to protect themselves online - more specifically their data - from unwanted observation, intrusion, or collection. This is a good starting point, but let’s dig a little further. For example, how much, and what kind of data about people can be collected online? How much of that really should be online? How much of that data should be collected? As I said earlier, online privacy is complicated, and these are just a few of the myriad questions there are to tackle when it comes to this topic.
(By the way, the definition above is paraphrased from [this source](https://www.bitdefender.com/cyberpedia/what-is-online-privacy/))

## There's More! ...A Lot More

First, what kinds of data are online, and how much of it is there? In short, a huge amount of data about pretty much everything you could think of exists online. The content you watch on streaming platforms and social media, the ads you click on, the amount of time you spend on website pages, to name a few, all generate data about your preferences and habits so that your experience can be more tailored, and ultimately so that you spend more time, energy, and money on those platforms/services. That’s just scratching the surface, though. Your financial credentials and personal information are also online, probably more than you would think or hope for. Your address, name, and other identity details are all data and are probably online somewhere. Many more types of data are collected when you use your devices and the Internet in general, but again, this is just a quick overview. 

How much of your data is online? The amount of data that’s available online, either publicly or otherwise, can vary widely depending on a few factors. For example, if you’re a prominent public figure, like a politician, a lot of information about yourself is going to be online, most of which is probably publicly available. If you want evidence for that, just look up a president and take a few minutes to gather all of the information you can on them. Of course, there are lots of other similar factors that may affect your online privacy, but if you’re just a regular, average person, then the factor that most affects your privacy is, well, your online activity! This includes everything from what services and platforms you use, to what you post and share on social media. For example, if you post often and share a lot of details about yourself on your public social media account, there’s going to be a lot of information out there about you that can be used by criminals, governments, and more.



Next, who wants your data? The answer is pretty much everyone. Malicious entities (hackers, criminals, etc.), corporations, your government, and even foreign governments want as much data as possible from as many people as possible. Hackers and criminals want data directly related to you, such as your social security number, name, address, and more, so that they can commit identity theft. They, of course, also want to know about sensitive financial details, such as banking information. Corporations, on the other hand, want information about your online behavior; as previously mentioned, data about online habits can be used to tailor online experiences and generate more revenue. What about governments, though? This one is a bit more difficult and it varies widely by your country and region, but for readers in the US, we’ll save the government story for another article. 

Finally, let’s go back to our definition of privacy for a moment. Recall that privacy is protection from unwanted intrusion. So in an online context, what should be defined as unwanted intrusion? It depends on a lot of factors and personal preferences. For example, if you’re a journalist in a heavily censored country, you probably consider most data collection to be unwanted, and you would want to maximize your online anonymity; just because you’re not a high-profile individual doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t care about online privacy, though. At the bare minimum, you probably don’t want criminals or thieves stealing your identity, right? As for corporations and online experiences, some people, (myself sometimes included) are okay with sacrificing privacy for convenience. It’s nice to get personalized videos on YouTube, for example, or a constant personalized feed of content on social media. Some people, on the other hand, believe that such personalization is creepy and uncomfortable. In a Constitutional context, one might define unwanted intrusion as unconstitutional access of citizens’ data through one means or another; some people might defend such access and consider it reasonable in the interest of national security. In short, what counts as unwanted intrusion depends on how much privacy you feel you want (or in some cases, need) online. Even though I love watching YouTube, I don’t love Google selling my data as much.
