# Online Privacy Awareness

Online Privacy Awareness is a project started by 2 students
for our goverment class. We're Casey and Kaya, by the way.

This project aims to spread awareness on the many issues of
online privacy and personal data in the digital age.
Furthermore, (for American readers) this project seeks to
educate people on online privacy in relation to the Fourth
Amendment, such as how the government has been and is
currently able to access your data, as well as the
constitutionality of these methods.
